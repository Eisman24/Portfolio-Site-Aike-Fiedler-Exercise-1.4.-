            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>I am a true northern light, grown up on the North Sea island Juist, I followed my passion after my Abitur and worked as a basketball coach. I have always been fascinated by the enthusiasm and solidarity created by sport.
              <p>Im an entrepreneur with 7 years experience of bootstrapping a company <a href="https://www.stickerstars.de" target="_blank">(Stickerstars)</a> , leading a team with 20 team members and running a business with +2 million annual revenue. </p>
   While studying to found a company at the HWR Berlin, I got to know Michael Janek. Together we developed the idea to make collecting albums possible for local clubs and founded Stickerstars in 2013.
              Since then we have developed the startup with a lot of heart and soul and are working on our vision together with 25 employees to make individual collecting experiences come true for every community.
              My passion is to found and initiate companies and projects. I love to inspire other people and to work together on something big.
              <p>My focus is on business modeling and product development, as well as initiating new ideas and opening up new business areas.  I haven't chosen the UX Design Course to become a UX Designer or to work in that field but more to use and
                apply this specific knowledge and methods for founding and realizing new ideas/products/companies.</p>
